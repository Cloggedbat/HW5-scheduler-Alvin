# Daily planner

Built by Alvin Clemens

This daily planner was a fun project, working with moment was a chalenge but with a little tinkering ended up great. This planner is controled by a function and a for loop. The function of wawa (a PA mini mart) controls saving though an on click event.

Then below a for loop is running moment set to military time that calls and reads the ID to compair the to. If it is <  > = then the past, present or future will be called from the CSS and the textarea will be changed to the set colors.

How this works

1. When you open the page you will see
    -10 text area boxes with times coresponing with buisness hours.
2. The time will be read from your computer
    -This will cause the text areas to respond the the time read.
    -If it is the past after what ever time is read then the area will be gray.
   - If it is beafore the time read then it will display future color green.
   - If it the time read is the same then it will display the present color red.
3. When you click within a box you will be able to write.
4. once you you have entered any text in to the text area you can then click on the button to the right and save.
